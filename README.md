# Overview

This study examined the collective offensive performance of NFL teams. Various factors were scrutinized to ascertain their impact on gameplay dynamics. Notably, the influence of venue, distinguishing between home and away contests, was analyzed alongside environmental variables such as ambient temperature and wind speed. Furthermore, longitudinal assessments were conducted to discern the variability in performance within the NFC North division across consecutive seasons. The synthesis of these datasets unveiled diverse correlations, subject to distinct limitations, which will be expounded upon in subsequent analysis.


## What is the effect on total points scored on being home vs away? 

Upon conducting a comparative analysis of the yardage acquired during home and away matches, no discernible correlation was observed. Teams demonstrated a consistent average yardage scored irrespective of their playing venue, indicating a lack of significant variance between home and away performances.


### How does overall temperature affect total yards gained in rushing and passing? 

Upon examining the aggregate yardage accrued, teams exhibited notable consistency in rushing yards, showing minimal variance relative to temperature fluctuations. However, passing yards demonstrated a positive correlation with temperatures ranging between 60-90 degrees Fahrenheit. This temperature range emerged as the most conducive environment for maximizing yardage gained through passing plays, thus indicating its significance in optimizing offensive performance.

#### How does overall wind speed affect total yards gained per game? 

A direct correlation has been established between wind speed and the yards gained per game. As wind speed escalates, there is a concurrent decrease in overall passing yards. The highest yardage thrown per game is observed on days characterized by low wind levels. Conversely, an inverse correlation exists between wind speed and rush yards per game, with an increase in wind speeds corresponding to a rise in overall rushing yards. This trend can be attributed to the decreased probability of completing a pass as wind speeds elevate, prompting teams to rely more heavily on rushing plays to advance the ball.


##### How do total yards fluctuate year to year in the NFC north?

Utilizing time series analysis to assess the comprehensive performance of each team revealed a notable diversity within the dataset. The total passing yards exhibited discernible fluctuations across three seasons. While certain teams, such as Minnesota, maintained a relatively stable performance in terms of overall passing yards, others, like Chicago, experienced marked variability between seasons.
Similarly, the aforementioned analytical approach was employed to examine total rushing yards, uncovering distinct fluctuations within each team's seasonal performance. Numerous confounding variables, including injuries and player transitions such as retirements or team changes, contribute to the challenge of maintaining consistency in overall team performance.

# Overview of Files in Project 1

There are 3 folders in project 1. Code, Output, Resources

## Code

In the folder "Code" you will find the "cleaning.ipynb" which was used to get and manipulate the csv file from resources which contains the database that we used. In this code we break down the data and manipulate it to create tables to use on our graphs.
In the folder "Code" you will also find the "graphs.ipynb" which was used to take the data from csv files that were created in the cleaning and turn them into graphs. 

## Output

In the output folder you will find the csv's for the tables created in "cleaning.ipynb" and images of the graphs created in "graph.ipynb".

## Resources 

In the Resources folder you will find the csv of all the data that we used for this project.
